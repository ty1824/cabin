Packed Cabin files must store folder contents contiguously. This is to optimize read
operations that read all files or contents within a given directory. Additionally,
all file contents of a folder must be represented in a chunk either before or after
subdirectory contents.

Given the following files:
`a/foo.txt`
`b/bar.txt`
`a/y/something.txt`
`a/baz.txt`
`c/fizz.txt`
`a/bang.txt`
`a/x/zero.txt`
`b/blah.txt`
`a/x/one.txt

One valid output representation would be
`a/foo.txt`
`a/baz.txt`
`a/bang.txt`
`a/y/something.txt`
`a/x/zero.txt`
`a/x/one.txt`
`b/bar.txt`
`b/blah.txt`
`c/fizz.txt`

File ordering within folders is not defined and should not be relied upon.
